DevOps Training
=======================================

DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams. It aims to streamline the software delivery process by automating and optimizing the building, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software applications.

The term "DevOps" is a combination of "development" and "operations," and it reflects the idea of breaking down the traditional silos between these two teams. DevOps practices include continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), infrastructure as code (IAC), and monitoring and logging tools, among others.

By adopting DevOps practices, organizations can improve the speed and quality of their software delivery, increase agility and innovation, and reduce costs and risks associated with software development and deployment. DevOps has become increasingly popular in recent years, particularly in organizations that rely heavily on software and technology to drive their business.
